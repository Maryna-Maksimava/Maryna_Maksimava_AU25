1.
The database contains only one user: postgres.

postgres is a superuser in PostgreSQL by default.
The database relies on superuser-only access.
There is no role separation (e.g. read-only, reporting, application roles).
2. 
Table-Level Privileges
all the privileges to tables are granted to postgres, only select (read) privileges are granted to PUBLIC.
3.
No row-level security policies are defined.
4. The database exists, but datconnlimit is not explicitly restricted.

In PostgreSQL, this means unlimited connections

5. presence of only postgres user, no role separation


Authentication is handled externally via pg_hba.conf
